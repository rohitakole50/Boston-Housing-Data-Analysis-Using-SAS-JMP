# Boston-Housing-Data-Analysis-Using-SAS-JMP

## Overview:

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset using SAS JMP software to learn predictive modeling techniques. The analysis includes creating various visualizations such as box plots, histograms, and scatter plots to demonstrate the correlation between different variables in the dataset. This project is part of the coursework for the Predictive Modeling class at the University of Connecticut.

## Objectives:

* To understand and apply predictive modeling techniques using the Boston Housing Dataset.
* To create visualizations that highlight the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
* To interpret the results and gain insights into the factors influencing housing prices in Boston.

## Key Components:

### 1. Dataset Description:

The dataset includes various features such as crime rate, proportion of residential land, non-retail business acres, proximity to the Charles River, nitrogen oxide concentration, average number of rooms, age of buildings, distances to employment centers, accessibility to highways, property tax rate, pupil-teacher ratio, percentage of lower economic status population, and median home values.

### 2. Visualizations and Analysis:

* **Bar Chart (MEDV vs. CHAS):** Compares median home values for homes near the Charles River versus those that are not.
* **Histogram and Box Plot (MEDV):** Shows the distribution and interquartile range (IQR) of median home values.
* **Scatter Plot (MEDV vs. LSTAT):** Analyzes the relationship between median home values and the percentage of the lower economic status population.
* **Scatter Plot (MEDV vs. TAX):** Explores the relationship between median home values and property tax rates.
* **Scatter Plot (MEDV vs. RM):** Investigates the correlation between median home values and the average number of rooms per dwelling.

### 3. Key Findings:

* Homes near the Charles River tend to have higher median values.
* The distribution of median home values is positively skewed.
* There is a negative correlation between median home values and the percentage of the lower economic status population.
* Higher property tax rates generally correspond to lower median home values.
* There is a positive correlation between the average number of rooms and median home values.

Tools and Technologies:

* SAS JMP software for data analysis and visualization.
* Microsoft Word for documenting the analysis and findings.

## Conclusion:

The Boston Housing Data Analysis project demonstrates the application of predictive modeling techniques to explore and understand the factors influencing housing prices in Boston. Through various visualizations and analyses, the project provides valuable insights into the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
